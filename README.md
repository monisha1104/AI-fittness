Creating an AI fitness application using Flask involves integrating artificial intelligence capabilities like exercise recognition, diet planning, and activity tracking into a web-based platform. Hereâ€™s how you can approach building such an application step by step:
Step 1: Set Up Flask
        Install Flask:
        Create a Flask App
Step 2: Implement Exercise Recognition
Choose or Train a Model:
Use pre-trained models from libraries like TensorFlow or train your own using datasets of exercises.
Integrate Model with Flask:
Step 3: Diet and Nutrition Recommendations
Design Recommendation System:
Develop an algorithm to suggest personalized diet plans based on user profiles, goals, and dietary preferences.
Integrate with Flask:
Step 4: Activity Tracking
Capture and Analyze Data:
Implement functionality to track user activities such as steps, calories burned, and heart rate.
Store and Present Data:
